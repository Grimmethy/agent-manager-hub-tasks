// Decompose-only pass (2026-09-02). A single model call -- NO tool loop, so it cannot run
// out of turns -- that decides whether an adhoc task is one focused implementation pass or
// a set of independent pieces, and if the latter, produces the sub-task JSON the
// coordinator machinery already consumes (parseSubTaskProposals -> queueSubTasks ->
// queue/coordinating/ -> coordinator-sweep.js).
//
// Producer 1 (adhoc decompose), moved from agent-manager core's src/decompose-pass.js (S4b
// of the hub-tasks extraction, 2026-09-25). See Docs/hub-tasks-extraction-plan.md
// (agent-manager repo). queueSubTasks/coordinator-sweep.js (the hub kernel) stay in core
// until S5; this module only proposes sub-tasks, it never files a hub itself.
//
// Three callers, all in core, reached through decompose-pass-route.js's swap point
// (register() below installs this as core's decompose-pass runner):
//   - the PRELIMINARY check (local-draft.js draftAdhocBranch), run after the blind plan
//     and BEFORE any agentic tier -- catches "this is 5 endpoints + a UI + tests" up front
//     instead of burning a 35-turn tier-3 pass on it.
//   - the SCOPE-COMPLEXITY gate (local-agentic-write-draft.js), also preliminary mode, for
//     a task judged structurally too broad before the first model call.
//   - the POST-EXHAUSTION / REPEATED-DECOMPOSE backstop (local-agentic-write-draft.js's
//     runGiveUpSplit) -- a rare safety net for a task that blew its whole tier-3 budget
//     without a single edit, or answered RESOLUTION: decompose twice without usable JSON.
